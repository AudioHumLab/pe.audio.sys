# pe.audio.sys

A PC based personal audio system: preamp, digital crossover and media players management.

This is based on **FIRtro** https://github.com/AudioHumLab/FIRtro/wiki and  **pre.di.c**  https://github.com/rripio/pre.di.c, a PC based digital preamplifier and crossover projects, designed by the pioneer **@rripio** and later others contributors.

Some *end user* and *user friendly* features has been added here.

## room correction EQ

Regarding your room correction EQ, you can use both IIR (parametric correction) or FIR (impulse correction). I prefer the last one, and I propose multipoint based correction, for example you can try my [multipoint DRC](https://github.com/Rsantct/DRC).
