## Playing CD

Enable CD playing in `config.yml`

    sources:
        ...
        ...
        cd:
            gain:           0.0
            jack_pname:     mpd_loop
            lu_offset:      0.0         # Optional. Depending on the CD mastering you usually
                                        # listen to, you would like to set 3, 6 or 9 dB

    # miscel
    cdrom_device:  /dev/cdrom


## Fine tuning Mplayer (OBSOLETE)

NOTE: before 2024-11 CD playing was in charge of Mplayer, currently it works with MPD.

On slow machines you may need to fine tune the Mplayer cache, see `~/.mplayer/config.sample`


## Apple Superdrive on Linux

Apple Superdrive prevents to run on not Apple machines :-/, but you can unlock this behavior :-)

Lets suppose your drive is attached on /dev/sr0, if not sure see your dmesg.

- Install package `sg3-utils`

    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install sg3-utils
    ```

- Try to enable the drive manually:

    ```
    $ sg_raw /dev/sr0 EA 00 00 00 00 00 01
    NVMe Result=0x0
    ```

Now, you can insert a CD.

- Automatic enabling by udev rules:

    ```
    $ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/60-Apple-Superdrive.rules
    ```

    ```
    # Initialise Apple SuperDrive
    ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1500", ATTRS{idVendor}=="05ac", DRIVERS=="usb", RUN+="/usr/bin/sg_raw /dev/$kernel EA 00 00 00 00 00 01"
    ```

- A crontab job to ensure the disc is ejected at the end of the day:

    ```
    # eject Apple SuperDrives because no tray eject button
    30 01 *  *  *    eject /dev/sr0
    30 01 *  *  *    eject /dev/sr1
    ```
