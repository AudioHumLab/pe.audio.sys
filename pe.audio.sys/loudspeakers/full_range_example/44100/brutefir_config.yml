#   XOver pcm files must be named as follow:
#
#       xo.XX[.C].XOSETNAME.pcm     where XX must be:  fr | lo | mi | hi | sw
#                                   and channel C is OPTIONAL, can be: L | R
#                                   if you want dedicated filtering
#
#
#   Full Range systems can avoid any XOver pcm file if you want not EQ at all.
#
#
#   `BrutefirId` out below must match with above, so valid names are:
#
#       fr.L    fr.R        for full range filters
#       hi.L    hi.R        for high pass
#       lo.L    lo.R        for low pass
#       sw                  for mixed subwoofer
#
#
#   DRC pcm files must be named:
#
#       drc.C.some_set_name.pcm  whe C must be `L` or `R`

# `drc_flat_region_dB` sets the unitary gain loudness when loading the
# PCM coefficient, then positive gains can occur if any.

# (i) If you have some drc set so that you want to apply some gain
#     compensation to by changing the drc in use, consider some extra dB
#     here, in addition to the flat level region of the coefficient itself.
