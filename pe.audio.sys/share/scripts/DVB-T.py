"""
    Starts and stops Mplayer for DVB-T playback.

    Also used to change on the fly the played stream.

    DVB-T tuned channels are ussually stored at
        ~/.mplayer/channels.conf

    User settings (presets) can be configured at
        pe.audio.sys/config/DVB-T.yml

    Usage:      DVB   start   [ <preset_num> | <channel_name> ]
                      stop
                      preset  <preset_num>
                      name    <channel_name>

    Notice:
    When loading a new stream, Mplayer jack ports will dissapear for a while,
    so you'll need to wait for Mplayer ports to re-emerge before switching
    the preamp input.
