"""
    A daemon that stops the Brutefir convolver if the preamp signal is too low.
    (This program needs loudness_monitor_daemon.py to be running)

    usage:   powersave.py  start | stop


    NOTICE:
    Brutefir has a powersave built-in feature, but if saving CPU% is insufficient,
    this script will completely stop the convolver dynamically.
