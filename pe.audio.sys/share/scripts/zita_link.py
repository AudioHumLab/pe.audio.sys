"""
    A LAN audio receiver based on zita-njbridge from Fons Adriaensen.

    See man zita-njbridge:

        ... similar  to  having analog audio connections between the
        sound cards of the systems using it

    Usage:    zita_link.py   start | stop


    NOTICE:

    This script replaces the former 'zita-xxx_mcast.py' versions.

    It runs just from the receiver side. The sender side zita-j2n process
    will be automagically triggered on demand from here.

    For easy usage, please customize the provided macros/examples/XX_RemoteSource

    Further info at doc/80_Multiroom_pe.audio.sys.md
