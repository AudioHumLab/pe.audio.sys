    A LAN multicast audio sender, from Fons Adriaensen's zita-njbridge.

    See man zita-njbridge:

        ... similar  to  having analog audio connections between the
        sound cards of the systems using it

    usage:    zita-j2n_mcast.py   start | stop


    (!) NOTICE:

    2ch 44100Hz 16bit will use about ~ 1.7 Mb/s network bandwidth (UDP packets)

    *** Multicast UDP must be used in a dedicated wired Ethernet LAN ***

    If your LAN uses WiFi, please do not use this script, you can use
    the new script 'zita_link.py' instead, just in the receiver side, the
    sender side zita-j2n will be automagically triggered from the receiver.
