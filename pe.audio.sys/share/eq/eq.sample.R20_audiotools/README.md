### Default curves `share/eq.sample.R20_audiotools`

From the `audiotools` project, these ones are the default for you to dump inside `share/eq/`

- Bass, treble and target curves have a 1st order slope, and spans from -12 dB to +12 dB

- Loudness contour curves spans from 0 to 90 phon, so that loudness compensation will be applied even when listening below 70 dBSPL (below level -13 dB, aka volume).
