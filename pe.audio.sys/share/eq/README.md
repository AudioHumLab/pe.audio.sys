Drop here the needed files for adjusting bass, treble, loudness contour and target room house curves that will be loaded into the Brutefir's EQ stage.

Find them here:

**`share/eq.sample.R20_audiotools/`**

For more details see here:

[60_system files.md](../../doc/60_system%20files.md)


**IMPORTANT:**

The `"eq"` section on your `brutefir_config` file **must match** the same frequency bands as inside the `share/eq/freq.dat` file.

A simple tool is available here:
