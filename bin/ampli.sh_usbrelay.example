# (i)   This amplifier switch is based on the 'usbrelay' binary,
#       which manages a simple HID usb relay unit.
#       Recently Debian offers the packet 'usbrelay'.
#       If not available, you can compile it by using the 'hidraw' library:
#           https://github.com/darrylb123/usbrelay
#       (It is needed to reboot the machine to usbrelay to work)
#
#       The 'usbrelay' executable:
#       - w/o args will show the status of the relays
#       - passing arg 'BITFT_x=y' will switch a relay (x:1|2, y:0|1)
#       (!) - the relay status is writen to stderr,
#           - additional info is written to stdout

# CONFIGURE YOUR RELAY HERE:
myRelay="BITFT_1"

# Switching:
if [[ $1 ]]; then
    tmp="$myRelay""=0"
    if [[ $1 == "on" || $1 == "1" ]]; then
        tmp="$myRelay""=1"
    fi
    usbrelay "$tmp"
fi

# Querying and saving the current status to ~/.amplifier
BITFT_1=$(usbrelay 2>&1 | grep BITFT_1)
BITFT_2=$(usbrelay 2>&1 | grep BITFT_2)
echo ${!myRelay} | cut -d"=" -f2 > "$HOME"/.amplifier
cat "$HOME"/.amplifier
